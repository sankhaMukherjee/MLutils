# Utility Functions for Machine learning

These are a set of functions that I can readily use on machine learning problems. I shall try to use utilities which are useful under most situations and will provide a relatively quick start at new machine learning problems. I expect that these set of utilities will be constantly growing so that over time I shall be able to command a respectable library for doing all sorts of machine learning tasks.
